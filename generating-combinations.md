# Generating Combinations

## **Problem:**

Given two positive integers, `n` and `k`, your task is to find all possible combinations of `k` numbers chosen from the range of numbers starting from 1 to `n`. You need to return these combinations as a list. The order of the combinations in the list does not matter.

For example, if `n` is 4 and `k` is 2, the possible combinations are:

* \[1, 2]
* \[1, 3]
* \[1, 4]
* \[2, 3]
* \[2, 4]
* \[3, 4]

Your goal is to write a function that takes `n` and `k` as inputs and returns a list of all such combinations.

Feel free to use any programming language of your choice to solve this problem.

## Solution:

You can solve this problem using a recursive approach to generate all possible combinations of `k` numbers chosen from the range \[1, n]. Here's a C++ function that implements this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void backtrack(int start, int n, int k, std::vector<int>& current, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& result) {
    if (current.size() == k) {
        result.push_back(current);
        return;
    }

    for (int i = start; i <= n; ++i) {
        current.push_back(i);
        backtrack(i + 1, n, k, current, result);
        current.pop_back();
    }
}

std::vector<std::vector<int>> combine(int n, int k) {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> result;
    std::vector<int> current;
    backtrack(1, n, k, current, result);
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n = 4; // Change these values as needed
    int k = 2;
    
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> combinations = combine(n, k);

    std::cout << "Combinations of " << k << " numbers chosen from [1, " << n << "]:\n";
    for (const auto& combination : combinations) {
        for (int num : combination) {
            std::cout << num << " ";
        }
        std::cout << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

You can modify the values of `n` and `k` in the `main()` function to get combinations for different inputs. The `combine` function generates the combinations using backtracking and returns a vector of vectors representing the combinations.

Remember to include the necessary headers (`#include <iostream>` and `#include <vector>`) at the beginning of your code.

let's break down the logic of the solution in a simple way:

1. We want to generate all possible combinations of `k` numbers from the range `[1, n]`.
2. We'll use a recursive approach to build these combinations.
3. The base case of the recursion is when we have chosen `k` numbers, we add the current combination to the result.
4. For each number `i` from `start` to `n`, we'll consider it as a potential candidate for the current combination.
5. We add `i` to the current combination and move on to the next candidate by calling the recursive function with `start` as `i + 1`.
6. After the recursive call, we remove the last added number from the current combination (backtrack) so that we can try the next candidate.
7. This process continues until we have `k` numbers in the current combination, at which point we add it to the result.

In summary, we're exploring all possible combinations of `k` numbers by trying each number from `1` to `n` as a potential candidate in the combination. Whenever we have a valid combination with `k` numbers, we add it to the final result.

The code uses the `backtrack` function to implement this logic, and the `combine` function initializes the process. Finally, the `main` function calls `combine` with the desired values of `n` and `k`, and prints the generated combinations.



***

The time complexity of the provided solution for generating all possible combinations of `k` numbers chosen from the range \[1, n] is O(C(n, k) \* k), where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of `n` items taken `k` at a time. The space complexity is O(k) for the recursion stack.

Explanation:

1. The outer loop runs `C(n, k)` times, where `C(n, k)` is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements. This loop generates all possible combinations by choosing each element as a starting point exactly once.
2. Inside the outer loop, the recursive function is called `C(n, k)` times, and each recursion explores up to `k` levels deep, generating a combination of size `k`.

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(C(n, k) \* k).

The space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion, which is `k`, since we are generating combinations of size `k` in each recursion. Therefore, the space complexity is O(k).

In practical terms, the complexity can vary based on the values of `n` and `k`. The binomial coefficient `C(n, k)` can become quite large, especially when `n` and `k` are close in value, leading to potentially large time and memory requirements. However, the recursive approach efficiently generates the combinations without explicitly storing them, which helps manage memory usage.
