# Matrix in spiral order

The code implements a function in C++ that takes a two-dimensional integer vector `matrix` as input, and returns a one-dimensional integer vector `result` that contains all elements of the input matrix traversed in a clockwise spiral order.

&#x20;The input matrix can have any number of rows `m` and columns `n`. If the input matrix is empty, the function returns an empty `result` vector. The code uses four integer variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix, and iteratively traverses the matrix in a clockwise spiral order. At each step, the code appends the current element to the `result` vector, and updates the corresponding boundary variable to exclude the already traversed row or column. The algorithm terminates when all elements have been visited.

Let's consider the following example:

```csharp
codematrix = [
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9, 10, 11, 12],
  [13, 14, 15, 16]
]
```

The function `spiralOrder(matrix)` will traverse the matrix in a clockwise spiral order, starting from the top-left corner, and append each element to the `result` vector. Here's the order in which the elements will be appended:

```csharp
[1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 15, 14, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 10]
```

Visually, the traversal looks like this:

```csharp
[1,  2,  3,  4]
[5,  6,  7,  8]
[9,  10, 11, 12]
[13, 14, 15, 16]
```

The traversal starts at the top-left corner, and moves right until it hits the boundary. Then it moves down until it hits the boundary, and so on. The traversal continues until all elements have been appended to the `result` vector in the clockwise spiral order.

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<int> spiralOrder(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
    vector<int> result;
    if (matrix.empty()) return result;
    int m = matrix.size();
    int n = matrix[0].size();
    int top = 0, bottom = m - 1, left = 0, right = n - 1;
    while (top <= bottom && left <= right) {
        // Traverse right
        for (int j = left; j <= right; j++) {
            result.push_back(matrix[top][j]);
        }
        top++;

        // Traverse down
        for (int i = top; i <= bottom; i++) {
            result.push_back(matrix[i][right]);
        }
        right--;

        // Traverse left
        if (top <= bottom) {
            for (int j = right; j >= left; j--) {
                result.push_back(matrix[bottom][j]);
            }
            bottom--;
        }

        // Traverse up
        if (left <= right) {
            for (int i = bottom; i >= top; i--) {
                result.push_back(matrix[i][left]);
            }
            left++;
        }
    }
    return result;
}

```

This solution initializes four variables to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix, and then iteratively traverses the matrix in a clockwise spiral order. At each step, it appends the current element to the `result` vector, and updates the corresponding boundary variable to exclude the already traversed row or column. The algorithm terminates when all elements have been visited.

The time complexity of the given solution is O(mn), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the input matrix. This is because the solution has to visit each element of the matrix exactly once to output the elements in a clockwise spiral order.

The solution iterates over the matrix in a clockwise spiral order and appends each element to the result vector. The total number of iterations is proportional to the number of elements in the matrix, which is mn. Therefore, the time complexity is O(mn).
